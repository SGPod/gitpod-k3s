# k3s on Gitpod

[![Gitpod ready-to-code](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs)

Just click on the button above and you will be in a Gitpod workspace with k3s running.

You can copy the `.gitpod.yaml` and the `.gitpod` folder to your own project to also have the k3s environment ready in there.

## Usage

At start, the workspace will start a VM in your gitpod workspace and
automatically install k3s on it. Your local environment will be automatically
configured to use that via the `kubectl`
